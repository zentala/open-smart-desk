# Open Smart Desk

## Overview
Make your height-adjustable desk smarter!
Track your time spent sitting and force yourself to stand or take a break. 

Built with RPi, relays, PIR sensor and laser distance meter. 
Should be compatible with any AC-driven standing desk.

## Project status
In development. 
* Finished hardware controler (v0.1). 
* Server is in the development now.

## Hardware
Note: **I don't recommend to build it as it is, because of a few known issues.**

### Known issues
* Plexi enclousore makes hardware almost not possible to access
* No mounting for the PIR sensor
* We can reduce costs replacing oversized components:
  * RPi4B with RPi zero 
  * 5V power supply 6A with 2A
